<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Alexander Sukennyk, a current Computer Science Masters Student at Cleveland State University
    <br> This website is currently a simple html placeholder while I work on a nicer looking one.
    <br> In the future, I hope to make this a thorough portfolio for interested parties.
    <br> <br> If you are hiring manager or employer, I jumped the gun and have nothing to show here yet! 
    <br> If you come from my resume with questions, I would gladly address them at my email, alexander.sukennyk@gmail.com, or by text at 440-341-0456.
    <br> Thanks for visiting, and have a nice day.
